Do TOB and Sherlock's audit scopes overlap with the C4 or have they reviewed different set of contracts?

[05/03/2023 20:23] ith.harvey
Yes they all overlap : ). Although TOB and Sherlock's audits also included the pools contracts which are not in scope of this audit.

I'm confused as to the automated Findings, if I report an issues before 24 hours and its also included in the automated Findings I'm I eligible for rewards?


[05/04/2023 00:22] shealtielanz
??


[05/04/2023 01:53] t.nero
No, those findings will be considered known issues.


[05/04/2023 03:48] 0xstalin
if you've found out a real med or high, it is most likely that the issue won't be reported by the bot, I'd say at least a 95% chance the bot won't report that issue


[05/04/2023 04:34] 0xjuntao
@dizzy , @Ith.harvey , @prat.gp  Hi, is the Ajna Technical Spec up to date? does the whitepaper still apply to the current implementation?


[05/04/2023 04:50] dizzy6247
hey, yes, the latest whitepaper published should apply to current implementation


[05/04/2023 04:55] 0xjuntao
cool, thanks


[05/04/2023 05:04] dizzy6247
np! got a question about chains deployment strategy, so posting here for visibility: the `ajna-core` contracts are going to be deployed to other chains as well but `ajna-grants` will remain entirely on L1 https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/MULTICHAIN_STRATEGY.md#design

where can i find the docs of the codebase/protocol ? not the whitepaper


[05/04/2023 20:00] 0xkazimm
in the repo it say only 3 contract is in scope but in the `scope` there is some lib and abstract contract, did all of them included in the scope ?


[05/04/2023 20:12] SpaceCake#8961
Noobie question 🙋‍♂️ : how far can we thinker with what is deployed on Goerli? Should I limit myself to something deployed locally on Ganache? Is deploying locally on Ganache going to help? My mind is telling me that it should be part of any audit, but I can't be sure.

🧐 

[05/04/2023 20:43] 0xstalin
I'd personally say you should stick to the version of the codebase that was submitted for the contest, sometimes the contracts deployed on public testnets or even mainnet may be previous versions of the codebase, where there could be previous issues that have been fixed in the version submitted for the contest

I'm curious about the bucket bankruptcy mechanism, any docs where this process is explained?


[05/04/2023 21:17] ith.harvey
Updated the Readme to reflect our deployment strategy ->

```
RewardsManager.sol ->    Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom, Tron, Avalanche
PositionManager.sol ->    Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom, Tron, Avalanche
GrantFund.sol ->    Ethereum mainnet

Another Question I have gotten twice now:
```
(bool success, bytes memory returndata) = targets_[i].call{value: values_[i]}(calldatas_[i]); This is a part of the _execute , targets[i] is supposed to be a smart contract address right as it is a proposal , it is not meant to be an EOA.
```
Yes `targets_` should always be the `ajnaTokenAddress` and `values_` should always be zero.

@Ith.harvey @kartoonjoy @CloudEllie 
I have a question, what would be the criteria for an issue submitted by a warden that was partially reported by the bot, but the bot didn't report all the occurrences of the issue across the codebase and the remediation of warden's issue requires a couple of extra steps?


[05/05/2023 06:32] pfapostol
the vulnerability itself is considered out of scope, regardless of instances. An exception if you can escalate an impact from the instance that is not presumed by the original vulnerability.


[05/05/2023 06:56] shealtielanz
I Don't think so, code4arena stated that they value better audit reports and a good coverage of a Vulnerability, also the Recommended Mitigation Steps.


[05/05/2023 06:57] pfapostol
not sure. it used to be like this, maybe something has changed after the bot races.

{Reactions}
🔥 

[05/05/2023 07:15] 0xjuntao
I agree, for example, the bot reported Loss of precision as low, but if you can find H/M issue due to precision loss, it's still valid


[05/05/2023 07:16] 0xjuntao
otherwise bot can simply report all the type of vulnerabilities, then no findings will be valid😂


[05/05/2023 07:24] 0xstalin
and even more important if the issue that you find out is caused by some precision loss that was not even reported by the bot.
For example, the bot reported lines 10, 15, and 20 to have precision loss issues, but then you find out that in line 95 there is also a loss of precision that combined with another factors would end up causing a H/M issue

{Reactions}
🔥 

[05/05/2023 07:24] 0xstalin
but let's see what the c4 team replies back


[05/05/2023 07:26] pfapostol
yes, that's what I meant. But if you find another precision loss that is not found by the bot, then you cannot report it as low, only as escalated issue.


[05/05/2023 07:27] pfapostol
how vulnerability is assessed is up to the judge, not c4

> Wardens may use automated tools as a first pass, and build on these findings to identify High and Medium severity issues ("HM issues"). However, submissions based on automated tools will have a higher burden of proof for demonstrating to sponsors a relevant HM exploit path in order to be considered satisfactory.

[05/05/2023 15:13] dizzy6247
that should work for `ajna-grants`. will be harder for `ajna-core` as we have change pranks that relies on prev `vm.prank` calls https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4835


[05/05/2023 15:18] simonpure
I haven't tried for `ajna-core` yet, but I also had to patch `changePrank` in `lib/forge-std/src/StdCheats.sol` for `ajna-grants` to make it work which is not pretty.

Looks like `changePrank` is going away based on the github thread you linked.


[05/05/2023 15:19] dizzy6247
yeah, `startPrank` will take it over

[05/08/2023 10:04] 0xnirlin

[05/08/2023 12:43] ith.harvey (pinned)
Got this a couple times so I want to make it clear-> The Final percentage of tokens per quarter for the treasury will be 3%... the spec is outdated, apologies.

Anyone know where I can get a valid ETH_RPC_URL to run the tests? Is there a local node provided via Hardhat? Trying to run tests with foundry

ERC20Votes issues should be an issue of type Governance?


[05/09/2023 21:20] ith.harvey
Some context to bucket bankruptcy ->
**Bucket bankruptcy**
- occurs on a withdraw of deposit or claimable collateral from a bucket if both are zero and yet there is outstanding LP balance for the bucket when the withdrawal is made, the previous LP balances are forfeited.  This can happen when there is bad debt, as the scaling factor may be 0.
- May not add deposit or claimable collateral to a bucket that has been bankrupted in the same block


[05/09/2023 22:08] niser93
Maybe i've some settings problem... test and gas report have very long duration (about 1 hour). It is right?


[05/09/2023 22:23] ith.harvey
no, that shouldn't be the case


[05/10/2023 01:59] mh9849
Did you set the ETH_RPC_URL value expected in .env?

Yes, i'm using my infura mainnet api key. When i run test-with-gas-report, it lasts about 10 minutes for ajna-core and 20 minutes for ajna-grants.
When i launch forge snapshot in order to report gas diff, it lasts 1 hour 😔


[05/10/2023 09:19] dizzy6247
try `forge snapshot --no-match-test "testLoad|invariant|test_regression"` these are time consuming tests

Names have been redacted. As you can see, Pie is the same but slice is not one user earns significantly more for the same issue

Why is this the case?


[06/08/2023 07:18] 0xnirlin
You can see 0.25, which means partial 25%, you got 25% of actual reward for issue.

Reason for that being are usually, low quality report, that may explain certain part of vulnerability and miss others.


[06/08/2023 07:20] 0xpathfindr
hmmm, the reason makes sense. Although I do feel my explanation for this issue was appropriate. Never the less, on to the next one.

Hi I recently participated in a contest on your platform and was awarded 22 USDC as a prize. However, despite my name being on the list of winners, I have not yet received the USDC in my wallet.

I am writing to request your assistance in resolving this issue and ensuring that the USDC is credited to my wallet.
